Compiling
---------

To compile asteroids, you need a recent version of SFML 2 (sfml-dev.org), Thor (developement version) (bromeon.ch/libraries/thor) and Boost (boost.org).

Tested versions are:

SFML2: commit 24f8c3535d (https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/zipball/24f8c3535d614b9a2f9cd147142c025f45a68f96)
Thor: commit e65ab28218 (https://github.com/Bromeon/Thor/zipball/e65ab28218a01766321a398f85f63b7fc4808653)

Use the VS2010 project file and edit the search-paths or create your own.

The compiled binary depends on the 'res' folder.
