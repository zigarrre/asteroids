=========

This is a remake of the game 'asteroids' in C++.

Compiling
---------

To compile asteroids, you need SFML 2 (sfml-dev.org), Thor 1.1 (bromeon.ch/libraries/thor) and Boost (boost.org).
Use the VS2010 project file and edit the search-paths or create your own.

The compiled binary depends on the 'res' folder.
