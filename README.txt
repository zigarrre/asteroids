Please report any bugs to the issue tracker on the project page! Feature requests and improvements are also welcome!

Compiling
---------

To compile asteroids, you need a recent version of SFML 2 (sfml-dev.org), Thor (developement version) (bromeon.ch/libraries/thor), Boost (boost.org) and a compiler which supports C++11.

Tested versions are:

SFML2: commit 91e1743516 (https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/tarball/91e1743516377e16d675b6486301aeba5b20bef8)
Thor: commit c06e016821 (https://github.com/Bromeon/Thor/tarball/c06e01682175ba6d8b2a4217e4634910e2df1d44)

Use the VS2010 project file and edit the search-paths or create your own.

The compiled binary depends on the 'res' folder.
