Please report any bugs to the issue tracker on the project page! Feature requests and improvements are also welcome!

Compiling
---------

To compile asteroids, you need a recent version of SFML 2 (sfml-dev.org), Thor (developement version) (bromeon.ch/libraries/thor), Boost (boost.org) and a compiler which supports C++11.

Tested versions are:

SFML2: commit 3c0de3e00e (https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/tarball/3c0de3e00e97d0ca8380b7b361d54c6fb501e74f)
Thor: commit 5182961751 (https://github.com/Bromeon/Thor/tarball/518296175173eeafda2e59908a3b5d18246244e3)

Use the VS2010 project file and edit the search-paths or create your own.

The compiled binary depends on the 'res' folder.
